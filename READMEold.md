## Overview
Xray_OS is a personal Arch Linux-based distribution created for my personal use - it's not intended as a competitor to other distributions. This is a curated system with custom tools and fixes for several use cases.

👉 Website: [Visit Xray_OS's page](https://xray-os.github.io/xray_os-website/)

## Key Features

- **🛠️ Custom AUR Helper** - Tolito-AUR-helper gets primarily curated in-house PKGBUILDs, AUR and custom configured repositories as fallback

- **🎨 Custom Wallpapers** - Original Xray_OS wallpapers (not sourced from elsewhere)
- **🖥️ Smart GPU Detection** - Automatically detects and removes unused GPU drivers during installation
